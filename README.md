# python-api-challenge

This repository is for Module 6 python api challenge. It contains WeatherPy and VacationPy folders which are the main scripts to run for each analysis. The .gitignore is also included to prevent exposing the api_keys.py file with API keys to the public. All the output files are inside the output_data folder, including one cities.csv and four plots.
